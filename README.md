## 欢迎来到李振的blog
基于jekyll的个人博客站点https://zhenmrlee.github.io/。

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.



For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZhenMrLee/ZhenMrLee.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
